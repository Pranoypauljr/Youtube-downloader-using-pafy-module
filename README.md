# Youtube-downloader-using-pafy-module

Its a simple piece of code which i found in instagram about dowloading yt videos using python

you can add the youtube video link in the space which i have specified in the code and if the code doesnt work for you please make sure you have installed pafy,youtube-dl library using pip command.once that is done mostly it should work.cheers:)

>Update1(09-10-2020):
i added some tkinter code so that a user window is opened when the .py file is executed so we can add the youtube url and click download and further find the downloaded video in the same directory as of the .py file.


peace!!
